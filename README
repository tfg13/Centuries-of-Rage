---------------------------------------------------------

1. GETTING STARTED

CoR needs the following components/libraries to run:
See Chapter 2 for instructions how to install them on your system.

- Java runtime (version 6)
  - Sun/Oracle JRE recommended - may work with others, but no support for them
- OpenGL & OpenAL
  - must be supported by your graphics chip
- LWJGL


---------------------------------------------------------

2. HOW TO INSTALL

Please note: There is no installer at this time.
You have to install everything manually.
We try to deliver an auto-installer ASAP.

WINDOWS:

- If not installed, install Java from java.com
- Make sure you have the latest drivers for you graphics card installed
- Download LWJGL from lwjgl.org and copy the .dll's to Windows/System32 folder.

LINUX:

- If not installed, install Java 6 Sun runtime environment.
  - (Ubuntu:) enable the "partner" repository & install "java-6-sun" package
- Download LWJGL from lwjgl.org and copy the .so's to /usr/lib
- Make sure OpenGL & OpenAL is installed

MAC:

- Download LWJGL from lwjgl.org and copy the .jnilib and .dylib into Libraries

---------------------------------------------------------

3. HOW TO RUN

WINDOWS:

There may be a "CoR.exe" located within the game-directory. Just doubleklick it.

ALL SYSTEMS:

- Depending on the way java is installed, it may work to double-click CoR.jar
- If not, try run it direct from the command-line:

java -Xmx512m -Xms512m -jar CoR.jar


4. FAQ

Q: The game does not start/crashes with cannot find * librarys.
A: Try to install the files mentioned in the error-dialog.
   If it says something about "native" libs the lwjgl.* (dll, so, jnilib) cannot be found.
   Try placing it somewhere else or point to it via -native-library-path=PATH
